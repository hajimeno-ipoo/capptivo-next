//! H.264 encoder selection. macOS always has VideoToolbox, but Windows and

//! The startup probe runs at 256×144, which says nothing about frames a

// --- Encoder tuning -------------------------------------------------------
//
// Every hardware encoder used to run bare, which meant FFmpeg's defaults: for
// NVENC that is the `p4` preset with multipass and lookahead, tuned for offline
// transcoding where quality-per-bit is the goal. Capptivo encodes screen
// recordings at 8–16 Mbps, where the bitrate is generous enough that the slow
// presets buy nothing visible and cost several times the encode wall time.
//
// These are throughput presets. They cannot make a *wrong* picture — they change
// how hard the encoder searches, not what it is asked to encode — so the risk
// here is an argument a driver rejects, not a quality regression. `select()`
// handles rejection by retrying the same encoder untuned, so an unsupported flag
// costs the tuning and never the hardware encoder.

/// NVENC: fastest preset, low-latency tune, single pass.
///
/// `p1` is the speed end of NVENC's preset ladder. `-tune ll` disables B-frames
/// and the lookahead buffer; `-multipass disabled` and `-rc-lookahead 0` say so
/// explicitly rather than trusting a driver default. `-surfaces 32` gives the
/// encoder a deeper input pool so it does not stall waiting on our pipe. This is
