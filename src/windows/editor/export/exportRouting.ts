/**
 * MP4 export route selection — the single place that decides how a file gets
 * encoded.
 *
 * There are exactly two routes, and both composite with the same Pixi
 * compositor the preview uses, so they are WYSIWYG-identical:
 *
 * - `annexb-ffmpeg` — WebCodecs H.264 (Annex-B) in the WebView → ffmpeg
 *   `-c:v copy`. Only compressed bytes cross IPC and nothing re-encodes. This is
 *   the fast path and it is preferred everywhere it can be *proven* to work
 *   (see `annexBProbe.ts` — declared support is not proof).
 * - `rgba-ffmpeg` — RGBA readback → ffmpeg hardware H.264 (nvenc/qsv/amf/mf/
 *   videotoolbox/vaapi, probed natively in `hw_encoder.rs`). Needs no WebCodecs
 *   whatsoever, which is what makes it a universal floor.
 *
 * What is deliberately *not* here any more: in-webview mediabunny MP4 muxing and
 * the MediaRecorder capture path. Both wrote MP4 bytes from inside the WebView,
 * both were the documented WebView2 failure mode, and MediaRecorder additionally
 * had to rewrite the user's chosen `.mp4` path to `.webm` when it could only
 * produce WebM. Fewer routes is the feature: every extra route is another
 * combination that works on one machine and not the next.
 *
 * Pure on purpose — selfchecks run under plain Node without Vite aliases.
