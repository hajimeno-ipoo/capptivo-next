## Download

No installer for this modified version has been published yet. Build from the
[current source](#quick-start) to use its changes.

| Platform            | What to grab                                               |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `aarch64` / `aarch64-apple-darwin` `.dmg` or `.app.tar.gz` |
| macOS Intel         | `x64` / `x86_64` `.dmg` or `.app.tar.gz`                   |
| Windows             | `.msi` or `*-setup.exe`                                    |
| Linux               | `.deb` / `.AppImage` / `.rpm`                              |

macOS builds are currently **unsigned**. On first launch: right-click → **Open**,
or allow Capptivo under System Settings → Privacy & Security. Grant **Screen
Recording** when prompted, then relaunch.

Captions need a system [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp)
`whisper-cli` binary; the app downloads the model weights on first use.

### Maintainers: cutting a release

GitHub Actions builds macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon), Windows, and Linux
installers — no local Windows/Linux machines needed.

1. Bump `version` in `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, and
   `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` (keep them identical).
2. Commit and push to `main`, then tag and push the tag (must match the
   version, e.g. `0.1.0` → `v0.1.0`):

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin main
git push origin v0.1.0
```

3. The [Release](https://github.com/hajimeno-ipoo/capptivo-next/actions/workflows/release.yml)
   workflow builds all platforms and opens a **draft** GitHub Release with the
   installers attached. Review the draft, then publish it.

You can also run the workflow manually from the Actions tab
(`workflow_dispatch`) without pushing a tag.

**Updater setup:** this repository has its own Tauri updater public key in
`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. Before publishing a release, securely back up the
matching private key from `src-tauri/.updater-keys/capptivo.key` and set the
`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` GitHub Actions secret. Never commit the private key.
Until a release is built with that key, automatic updates are unavailable.

**Signing:** builds are unsigned for now. macOS users may need right-click →
Open once. When you have Apple / Windows certificates, add the usual Tauri
signing secrets (`APPLE_CERTIFICATE`, `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`,
`APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`,
and/or Windows `TAURI_SIGNING_*`) in the repo Settings → Secrets.

**Permissions:** if the workflow fails with “Resource not accessible by
integration”, set Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions to
**Read and write**.

## Platforms

Capptivo runs on:

- **macOS** 13.0+
- **Windows** 10 build 1903+ (May 2019 Update)
- **Linux** on modern distros with PipeWire 1.0+ (e.g. Ubuntu 24.04+) — X11 and Wayland

Platform notes:

- **macOS** captures through native **ScreenCaptureKit** with **VideoToolbox** hardware
  H.264 encoding; system audio comes from a companion SCK stream.
- **Windows** captures through native **Windows.Graphics.Capture**, with hardware
  encoding probed per machine (NVENC / QuickSync / AMF / Media Foundation) and
  system audio via **WASAPI loopback**.
- **Linux** captures through **xdg-desktop-portal + PipeWire** — the screen/window is
  picked in the system dialog. System audio comes from the PulseAudio/PipeWire
  monitor. Cursor replay / follow-zoom use an X11 pointer probe on X11 sessions,
  and PipeWire cursor **Metadata** on Wayland when the portal supports it
  (otherwise the cursor is embedded in the recording and zoom-follow is unavailable).
  Area selection isn't available yet on Linux — crop in the editor instead.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
```

Requires **Rust**, **Node**, and **pnpm**. FFmpeg is fetched automatically as a
per-platform sidecar on first dev/build (`scripts/fetch-ffmpeg.mjs`), installed
as `capptivo-ffmpeg` / `capptivo-ffprobe` so Linux packages do not collide with
the system `ffmpeg` package.

macOS: grant Screen Recording in System Settings on first launch, then relaunch.  
Open the recorder with **⌥⇧R** (**Alt+Shift+R** on Windows/Linux), or click the tray icon.

---

## Architecture

```
Capture  →  bounded frame channel  →  FFmpeg / VideoToolbox  →  screen.mp4
Cursor   →  cursor.json
UI       →  typed IPC projection of Rust state
Editor   →  media:// (HTTP Range) + canvas compositor → export
```

Rust owns capture, encoding, and storage. The React shell is presentation only — domain modules never import `tauri::*`.

```

├── commands/     # thin IPC adapters
└── …             # tray, windows, media protocol
```

## Development

```bash
pnpm tauri dev                 # app + Vite
cd src-tauri && cargo test --no-default-features
cargo check --no-default-features
